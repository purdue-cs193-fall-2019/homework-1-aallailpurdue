# Ali Allail's First CS193 Homework

## My favourite thigs about CS193 include:
  - The instructors are really cool (extra points plz).
  - The TAs are so extremely cool (TAs do the grading right?).
  - CS193 introduces cool tools (hence the name) that are going to be useful to us (like this one). 
  - There are neverending cool stuff we learn but I will stop here because, you know, time is valuable.
